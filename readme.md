# Personal Learnings
I have learned many things with this first project. The above listed technologies are just one aspect. Creating a website can be quite complex. Building out the design on paper (or other medium) is very helpful in planning out the code required to build a site. I also learned specificity in regards to CSS is truly an art and requires further practice. Understanding and applying my knowledge of HTML and CSS is still a work in progress, and I hope to improve over time.
